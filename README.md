## Features
In this project, you will find two pages:

- The main page where you can choose between three movie options: "Upcoming, Popular, and Top Rated." In addition to this, you can view the list of movies with their posters, names, release dates, and ratings.

- The movie detail page: By clicking on a movie, you will be redirected to a page where you can see all the details of the movie, such as duration, cast, budget, etc.

## Contributing
You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Deploy on Vercel

I have deployed it with [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme), it provides an easy way to deploy projects using NextJS.
