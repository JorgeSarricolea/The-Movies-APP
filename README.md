This project showcases my skills in fetching data from [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org). It combines the power of React to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces, TypeScript for secure and efficient management of data types extracted from the API, Tailwind CSS for modern styles, and Next.js for swift and efficient deployment.
